 A simple rasterization routine from the internet:

The next steps are partial rasterization. This involves, I'm assuming, applying this simple routine to
both the full triangle and just the outline to get the exterior cells. For just these exterior cells,
we will calculate the geometry of the overlapping vector portion and use that to calculate the percent
inclusion, applying that value to the target grid. Then we replace the exterior full grid cells with the
new % inclusion exterior cells.
